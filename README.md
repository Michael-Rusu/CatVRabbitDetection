# Simple Image Classifier using TensorFlow 


This is a simple CNN model that uses TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning framework, to classify images. It is built using Python and utilizes the Keras API to simplify the development process.

> The reason why the images are in an output folder was due to using a data augmentation library to help with overfitting

## Prerequisites

Before running this image classifier, make sure you have the following installed:
```
JUPYTER NOTEBOOK (IMPORTANT)
tensorflow
numpy
pandas
opencv-python
matplotlib
tqdm
glob
tensorflow-data
```

### Getting Started

To use this image classifier, follow these steps:


1) Clone this repository to your local machine.

2) Navigate to the directory where the repository is located.

3) Locate a new directory called "data" and place your training images in **train-cat-rabbit/output**. You should have at least two directories inside "output" named after your image classes(cat, rabbit).

4) Run the **CatVsRabbit.ipynb** script to train the image classifier using your data.
